                <ul>I built it from scratch, that is why it looks so simple. I've been having a lot of trouble in this<br>
                    class so I wanted to see if I could do it.</ul><br>
            <li><strong>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</strong></li><br>
                <ul>The most challenging part for me was just getting everything to work properly. I also had a lot of trouble<br>
                    learning how Github works.</ul><br>
            <li><strong>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</strong></li><br>
                <ul>This class made me realize just how much work goes into a single web page.</ul><br>    
            <li><strong>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</strong></li><br>
                <ul>For future students I would say remain patient and keep trying. It would also be good to learn how<br>
                Github works.</ul>
